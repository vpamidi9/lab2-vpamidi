Nets with multiple drivers

The following nets have multiple drivers and at least one of the drivers is     
non-tristate:

Timing exceptions with no effect

The following timing exceptions are not currently affecting timing in the       
design.  Either no paths in the design satisfy the exception's path             
specification, or all paths that satisfy the path specification also satisfy an 
exception with a higher priority.  You can improve runtime and memory usage by  
removing these exceptions if they are not truly needed.  To see if there is a   
path in the design that satisfies the path specification for an exception, or   
to see what other exception is overriding an exception because of priority, use 
the command:                                                                    
  report timing -paths [eval [::legacy::get_attribute paths <exception>]]

Inputs without clocked external delays

The following primary inputs have no clocked external delays.  As a result the  
timing paths leading from the ports have no timing constraints derived from     
clock waveforms.  The'external_delay' command is used to create new external    
delays.
